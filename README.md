40+ Common code and interview problems solved in Python (it's growing...)

### The core idea is not to utilize built-in functions or library and giving it a more logic-based approach, so that it can be language-friendly and not end up being another repository of "Python Tips and Tricks" .

## How good is the code ?
* It is well tested
* It passes style checks (PEP8 compliant) [TODO]
* It can compile in its current state (and there are relatively no issues)

## How much support is available?
* FAQs (coming soon)
* Documentation (coming soon)

## Issues
Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.
